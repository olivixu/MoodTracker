## 🎨 Design Highlights

### Color System
- **Mood-based colors**: Dynamic coloring from red (low) to green (high)
- **Gradient fills**: Smooth visual representation of mood areas
- **Semantic colors**: Using system colors for dark mode support
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, clear visual hierarchy

### Animations
- **Spring animations**: Natural, bouncy feel for handle interactions
- **EaseInOut**: Smooth transitions for mood value changes
- **Scale effects**: Visual feedback when dragging
- **Shadow animations**: Dynamic shadows based on interaction state

### Typography
- **SF Pro**: Native iOS font for consistency
- **Monospaced digits**: Clean numerical displays
- **Dynamic Type**: Supports user font size preferences
- **Hierarchy**: Clear heading, body, and caption styles

## 🔧 Key Components

### MoodManager
**Purpose**: Central state management and business logic

**Responsibilities**:
- Timer management (10-minute intervals)
- Data persistence (SwiftData)
- Mood entry CRUD operations
- Statistics calculations
- Haptic feedback coordination

**Key Methods**:
- `startTimer()`: Initiates auto-advancement
- `saveMoodEntry()`: Persists current mood
- `fetchEntries(for:)`: Retrieves historical data
- `averageMood(for:)`: Calculates statistics

### MoodGraphView
**Purpose**: Reusable graph visualization component

**Features**:
- Grid system with mood levels and time markers
- Line and area rendering for mood data
- Interactive mode (with handle) vs read-only mode
- Configurable labels and styling
- Responsive to container size

### DraggableHandle
**Purpose**: Interactive mood input component

**Features**:
- Smooth drag gesture
- Position-to-mood value conversion
- Visual feedback (scale, shadow, color)
- Haptic feedback integration
- Clamping to valid mood range

## 📊 Data Model

### MoodEntry
```swift
@Model
final class MoodEntry {
    var date: Date              // Start of day (normalized)
    var timeSlot: Int          // 0-143 (10-minute intervals)
    var moodValue: Double      // -5.0 to +5.0
}
```

### Time Slots
- **144 slots per day**: 24 hours × 6 (10-minute intervals/hour)
- **Auto-advancement**: Timer triggers every 10 minutes
- **Immutable past**: Locked after time slot passes
- **Current slot**: Always editable

### Mood Scale
- **Range**: -5.0 to +5.0 (11-point scale)
- **Granularity**: 0.1 increments for smooth dragging
- **Labels**: Excellent, Good, Okay, Neutral, Low, Bad, Very Low
- **Emojis**: 🤩 😊 🙂 😐 😕 😞 😢

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Open the `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed Xcode setup instructions
